## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle length and Ground clearlesce provided a non-random variance to the mpg values in the dataset. since they are highly significant their p-value very very less than 0.05.


* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Slop is not zero because we have predictors that have non zero value for estimates of their independent variables, few are significant variable as well. 

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Yes this liner model predict mpg pretty adequately since the Adjust R-squared is 68% times of the veriation in data can be explained by this model.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
