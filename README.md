## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle length and Ground clearlesce provided a non-random variance to the mpg values in the dataset. since they are higly significant their p-value very very less than 0.05.


* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Slop is not zero because we have predictors that have non zero value for estimates of their independent variables, few are significant variable as well. 

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Yes this liner model predict mpg pretty adequately since the Adjust R-squared is 68% times of the veriation in data can be explained by this model.
